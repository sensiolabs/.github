# Hey ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ‘¾ About us

<a href="https://sensiolabs.com"><img align="right" src="./assets/logo_sensiolabs.jpeg" width="150" alt="Sensiolabs" /></a>


SensioLabs was originally founded as a web agency by [Fabien Potencier](https://github.com/fabpot) and Gregory Pascal.

Back in 2005, **SensioLabs created the Open-Source PHP framework [Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony)**, which became a global reference in web development and PHP.

Even though Symfony is an Open-Source project, **SensioLabs continues to strongly support the development of the framework and to help the organizations that use it**. As the creator of Symfony, SensioLabs is the premier service provider for Symfony, offering a comprehensive range of consulting, expertise, and development services, and operating the official Symfony training center.


## ðŸ’» What we do

**[SensioLabs](https://sensiolabs.com/) boasts the largest number of Symfony certified developers in the world**, and our technical team strives to make developers' lives easier in every project we work on. SensioLabs also stands out with a quality-focused approach, advocating for tools, methodologies and services that enable developers to work in the best possible way.

Our technical team is very active, **contributing to the core of Symfony** and documentation, **participating in the community**, writing articles, speaking at technical conferences, promoting open source, etc. Our mission is also to **educate and evangelize** web developers to continue the extraordinary adventure that is Symfony.

Here are some resources you can find to follow us ðŸ‘‡
